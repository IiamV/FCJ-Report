**On this page**, I will introduce my worklog.

**How did I complete it?**  
I completed this worklog by following a structured **AWS learning roadmap** provided during the internship, combining theoretical study with extensive **hands-on labs and workshops**. I practiced directly using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and Infrastructure as Code tools such as **CloudFormation and AWS CDK**.  
As a **React Frontend developer**, I also focused on understanding how frontend applications integrate with AWS backend services, load balancers, authentication systems, and APIs deployed in secure cloud environments. Throughout the program, I documented my learning progress, configurations, challenges, and solutions on a weekly basis.

**How many weeks did it take?**  
I completed this internship and training program over a period of **12 weeks (3 months)**, starting in September 2025 and concluding in December 2025.

**What did I do in those weeks?**  
Over the course of 12 weeks, I progressed from AWS fundamentals to advanced cloud architectures, DevOps practices, security, and application modernization. The program culminated in a **final group project** where we deployed a **highly available N-Tier architecture on AWS**.  
In this project, I was responsible for the **React frontend**, ensuring proper integration with backend services hosted in private subnets and accessed through load balancers, while following AWS security and scalability best practices.
