### [Blog 1 - Optimizing cost savings: The advantage of Amazon Aurora over self-managed open source databases](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog argues that Amazon Aurora delivers substantial cost savings compared with self-managed MySQL/PostgreSQL, thanks to its cloud-native design: a shared, distributed storage layer across Availability Zones removes the need for multiple redundant storage volumes and extra replica nodes, while still offering high availability, scalability, and reliability.

### [Blog 2 - How Karrot Built its Feature Platform on AWS, Part 2: Feature ingestion](3.2-Blog2/)
The article shows how running Werum PAS‑X MES Suite on AWS Outposts with containerization (e.g. via Amazon EKS) enables life-sciences manufacturers to retain on-premises execution (for compliance, latency, data-locality) while gaining cloud-native manageability, resiliency, and oversight through AWS tooling.

### [Blog 3 - Deploy LLMs on Amazon EKS using vLLM Deep Learning Containers](3.3-Blog3/)
This announcement introduces AWS IoT Device SDK for Swift, enabling developers to build IoT applications in Swift more easily by offering native libraries and APIs for connecting Swift-based devices to AWS IoT Core, streamlining development of Apple-platform-based IoT solutions.
