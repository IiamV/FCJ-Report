### [Blog 1 - Optimizing cost savings: The advantage of Amazon Aurora over self-managed open source databases](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog argues that Amazon Aurora delivers substantial cost savings compared with self-managed MySQL/PostgreSQL, thanks to its cloud-native design: a shared, distributed storage layer across Availability Zones removes the need for multiple redundant storage volumes and extra replica nodes, while still offering high availability, scalability, and reliability.

The article shows how running Werum PAS‑X MES Suite on AWS Outposts with containerization (e.g. via Amazon EKS) enables life-sciences manufacturers to retain on-premises execution (for compliance, latency, data-locality) while gaining cloud-native manageability, resiliency, and oversight through AWS tooling.

### [Blog 3 - Introducing the AWS IoT Device SDK for Swift (Developer Preview)](3.3-Blog3/)
This announcement introduces AWS IoT Device SDK for Swift, enabling developers to build IoT applications in Swift more easily by offering native libraries and APIs for connecting Swift-based devices to AWS IoT Core, streamlining development of Apple-platform-based IoT solutions.
