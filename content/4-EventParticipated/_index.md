## Event 1: “AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop”
**Date:** November 15, 2025  
**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office (Bitexco Tower)  
**Role:** Attendee  

**Overview:**  
The workshop introduced the AI/ML ecosystem on AWS, including the end-to-end machine learning workflow using **Amazon SageMaker** and advanced **Generative AI** capabilities with **Amazon Bedrock**. Speakers also demonstrated how to build RAG-based systems and AI Agents for production use cases.

**What I Learned:**  
- How SageMaker supports data preparation, training, tuning, and deployment.  
- How to evaluate and apply Foundation Models (Claude, Llama, Titan).  
- Techniques in prompt engineering and implementing RAG for higher accuracy.  
- The importance of guardrails and governance when deploying GenAI applications.
