### Personal Reflections

The internship at First Cloud Journey gave me exposure to a working environment that places strong emphasis on technical depth and independent execution. Throughout the program, I had the chance to explore AWS services, collaborate with mentors, and work on tasks that reflected practical industry scenarios rather than purely academic exercises.

### Internship Experience

**Working Environment**  
The workspace is structured in a way that encourages focus and autonomy. Interns are expected to manage their own progress, set priorities, and communicate when facing challenges. This level of independence helped me build confidence when approaching unfamiliar technologies.

**Guidance and Mentoring**  
Instead of constant supervision, the mentoring style allowed room to experiment and validate ideas on my own. Feedback was typically provided during review sessions or when I presented completed work. This approach encouraged me to justify design choices and understand the trade-offs behind each architectural decision.

**Learning Outcomes**  
The most valuable aspect of the program was being able to work directly with cloud components rather than only studying them conceptually. Configuring infrastructure, troubleshooting misconfigurations, and reviewing AWS best practices all contributed to my technical growth. I particularly benefited from researching service limitations and understanding how different components fit together.

**Professional Culture**  
The culture at FCJ promotes responsibility and respect for shared resources. While the team does not rely heavily on social interaction, there is a clear expectation of professionalism. Administrative requests, such as tool access or environment setup, were resolved efficiently, which helped maintain an uninterrupted workflow.

### Additional Thoughts

**Most Meaningful Moment**  
Completing key milestones in the project using my own research and problem-solving process was particularly rewarding. It demonstrated that I could take ownership of a task and deliver results without depending heavily on external guidance.

**Recommendation**  
I would recommend this internship to students interested in cloud infrastructure or those who want a hands-on technical environment. The program suits individuals who prefer learning through exploration rather than predefined instructions.

**Final Note**  
Overall, the internship has been a meaningful experience and has helped me connect theoretical knowledge with real-world implementation. I appreciate the opportunity to work in an environment that challenges me to grow both technically and professionally.
